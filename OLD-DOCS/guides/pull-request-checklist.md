- [ ] Code has no magic numbers. `./src/Utils/Core/Constants/TimeConstants.ts` are used where appropriate.
- [ ] Code Follows the AHA principle (avoid hasty abstractions).
- [ ] Code follows SOLID principles:
  - [ ] **Single Responsibility Principle** - Every Component/Objects/Function should have only one responsibility.
  - [ ] **Open Closed Principle** - Components/Objects/Functions should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  - [ ] **Liskov Substitution Principle** - A child class should be able to replace its parent class without unexpected behavior
  - [ ] **Interface Segregation Principle** - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use.
  - [ ] **Dependency Inversion Principle** - High-level modules should depend on abstractions, NOT low level modules.
- [ ] Files follow the defined [File Structure](#file-structure) and the [File Structure Conventions](#file-structure-conventions).
- [ ] New Linting Disable comments follow the [Linting & Prettier Disable Conventions](#linting--prettier-disable-conventions).
- [ ] Modules/Components have [Story Book](#story-book) stories written.
- [ ] CSS styles are defined using using [Material UI Styles](#material-ui-styles) or [Emotion Styled Components](#emotion-styled-components).
- [ ] CSS styles are using values from the [Material UI Themes](#material-ui-themes) where applicable (palette, typography, shadows, transitions, zindex).
- [ ] Relative inks are implemented using [React Router](#react-router).
- [ ] Pages have [Helmet](#helmet) tags set.
- [ ] Dates use [Day.js](#dayjs) or have a good reason not to (Day.js is compatible with [MUI Date/Time Picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#setup)).
- [ ] Tests are written to closely resemble how web pages are interacted with by the users.
- [ ] Tests avoid testing implementation details (in accordance with the [Testing Library Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/#what-you-should-avoid-with-testing-library)).
- [ ] Test coverage is above 80%.
- [ ] Storybook a11y tests are passing (TODO: Link to storybook accessibility testing section)
- [ ] Linters are not throwing errors or warnings.
- [ ] Prettier has been ran.
- [ ] UI is implemented correctly in light and dark mode
- [ ] Works on small and big screens, touch and non touch devices
- [ ] Don't break the back button

      TODO: time constants are using the constants defined in the utils
- [ ] React `useEffect()`...[You might not need an effect](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)
  - [ ] If you can calculate something during render, you don’t need an Effect.
  - [ ] To cache expensive calculations, add useMemo instead of useEffect.
  - [ ] To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different key to it.
  - [ ] To reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering.
  - [ ] Code that runs because a component was displayed should be in Effects, the rest should be in events.
  - [ ] If you need to update the state of several components, it’s better to do it during a single event.
  - [ ] Whenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up.
  - [ ] You can fetch data with Effects, but you need to implement cleanup to avoid race conditions.
