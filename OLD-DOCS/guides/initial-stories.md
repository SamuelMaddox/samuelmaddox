# Initial Stories

- Add favicon to project
- Update site meta data (title, description)
- Define a project theme by following the `/docs/guides/tailwind-theme-setup.md` guide found in the project
- Icon Library Setup (See guide in this repo)
- Make a better looking theme selector component, and add a story
- Create a color palette and typography component purely for storybook documentation
- For NextJS projects there needs to be a story to update `metadata` in the `layout.tsx` file:

  ```ts
  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: "Create Next App",
    description: "Generated by create next app",
  };
  ```

- add forbidden and not found pages
- add favicon
- docusaurus favicon and logo (probably the same as main application)
