## Guide coming soonâ„¢

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is known for it's end-to-end testing. They are now [experimenting with component testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components). This might be an improvement over [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) since the playwright component tests run in a real browser instead of JSDOM.

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. [-Kent C. Dodds](https://x.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)
