There is an option for config files to be defined using typescript, `eslint.config.mts`. It requires `jiti` as an optional dev dependency. Native support for typescript without the need for jiti is in experimental as of Node.js >= 22.10.0 (See [--experimental-strip-types](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/cli.html#--experimental-strip-types) flag).
