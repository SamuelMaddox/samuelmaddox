# 游뚾 Tailwind CSS

## Installation

Follow the [Tailwind CSS installation instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) for your chosen framework or build system

## VS Code Extension

Add the following to the `.vscode/extensions.json` file.

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    . . .
    "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss"
  ]
}
```

## clsx() Utility

:::tip
Source: [clsx() Tailwind Support](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx?tab=readme-ov-file#tailwind-support)
:::

The [`clsx()`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) utility is useful for constructing `className` strings conditionally.

Install it by using this command:

```terminal
pnpm add --save clsx
```

Then add the following property to the `.vscode/settings.json` file. This will allow the Tailwind VS Code extension to continue working:

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["clsx\\(([^)]*)\\)", "(?:'|\"|`)([^']*)(?:'|\"|`)"]
  ]
}
```

## Official Prettier Plugin

:::info
Source: [`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
:::

Install `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` by using this command:

```terminal
pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

Then add the plugin to the `.prettierrc` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["游리...Other Plguins", "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"],
  "tailwindStylesheet": "{游리 PATH_TO_CSS_FILE_ENTRY_POINT_THAT_IMPORTS_TAILWIND}",
  "tailwindFunctions": ["clsx"]
}
```

## Unofficial ESLint Plugin

:::warning
As of 04/08/2025

- There is no official ESLint plugin released for Tailwind CSS.
- There is the unofficial but decently popular [`eslint-plugin-tailwindcss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss). However it is NOT YET compatible with Tailwind v4.0
- `@eslint/css` has a language option for custom TailwindCSS syntax. However, it has not been updated for TailwindCSS 4.0. That section of the config might need to be commented out until the language option has been updated

:::

Install `@eslint/eslintrc` by running this command:

```terminal
pnpm add --save-dev eslint-plugin-tailwindcss
```

Update the `eslint.config.mjs` file with the following:

```ts
// ...
import { tailwindSyntax } from "@eslint/css/syntax";
import tailwind from "eslint-plugin-tailwindcss";

// ...

export default defineConfig([
  // ...
   {
    files: ["**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,mjs,cjs,mts,cts}"],
    extends: [
      // ...
      // TODO: Does this work yet for TailwindCSS v4.0?
      tailwind.configs["flat/recommended"],
    ],
    rules: { ... },
  },
  // TODO: Does this work yet for TailwindCSS v4.0?
  {
    files: ["**/*.css"],
    // ...
    languageOptions: {
      tolerant: true, // 游리 This may be required due to custom syntax that TailwindCSS uses
      customSyntax: tailwindSyntax, // 游리 This has not been updated yet for TailwindCSS v4.0
    },
  },
]);
```

## Project Documentation

### 1. Update `98-vs-code-extensions.md` Documentation

```

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title="docusaurus/docs/95-eslint.md">
  {TailwindCSSProjectDocs}
</CodeBlock>
