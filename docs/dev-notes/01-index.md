description: When setting up local dev environments and new projects I do not always have access to old projects to reference what I had previously done. Even when I do, it is sometimes difficult to remember what files I need to reference, or extrapolate why I did something in a particular way. So I have taken to writing personal guides and notes as a jumping-off point for future use. I thought others might find these guides and notes useful, so I have published them here.
