# Introduction

When setting up new projects and tools I don't always have access to old projects to reference what I had previously done. Even when I do, it is still sometimes difficult to remember what files I need to reference, or extrapolate why I did something the way I did. So, I have taken to writing guides and notes as a jumping off point in the future. I figured others may find these guides and notes useful as well. So here they are published.
