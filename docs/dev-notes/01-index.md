# Introduction

When setting up new projects and tools, I do not always have access to old projects to reference what I had previously done. Even when I do, it is sometimes still difficult to remember which files I need to reference or to extrapolate why I did something in a particular way. Therefore, I have taken to writing guides and notes as a jumping-off point for future use. I thought others might find these guides and notes useful, so I have published them here.
